Longest palindromic substring:
    - code seems to work
    - feedback is given and implemeted
    - there is question on feedback, answer pending

Reverse linked list:
    - All bugs are fixed
    - Code seems to work
    - Feedback pending

Reverse sentence in c-string:
    - feedback given and code merged into master
    - TODO: verify runtime

House Robber:
    - code seems to work for small inputs
    - verify why leetcode says "time exceeded."
    - verify runtime complexity
    - waiting for coding style based feedbacki
    - check if it needs a cache to allow dynamic programming

Find Missing (number):
    - code seems to work
    - feedback given + implemented
    - merge pending

Rotate Matrix 2D - one:
    - code seems to work
    - PR created
    - feedback pending
    - TODO: verify what exactly ln27 is doing

Rotate Matrix 2D - two:
    - unclear understanding
    - no code added yet
    - read explanation here:

Palindromic Linked List:
    - code seems to work
    - feedback given: code can be cleaned up
    - better solution from leetcode (url is living on messenger)

Merge two (sorted) linked lists:
    - code seems to work
    - leetcode tests pass
    - unit tests pass
    - merge approval pending

Maximum subarray:
    - code seems to work and UT pass
    - feedback pending
    - some leetcode tests give "time exceeded error"
    - look at leetcode solutions to use a better approach than the current
    O(N^2) approach

Length of last word:
    - code works 
    - UT and leetcode tests pass
    - feedback: currently, a flag is used to verify if we are looking at the "actual" last word. An extension to this problem is to find the last but nth word from the sentence. A flag can be used to track the number of words seen, or a helper function can be used to skip n words (verify this). Either option must be explored in a brand new problem which will extent the current problem.
    - current problem's PR can be closed.

Plus one:
    - code works
    - UT and leetcode tests pass
    - Shridhar sent some good code for this problem

Add binary:
    - code works
    - feedback: why convert to decimal? Can you add two bin strings directly?

sqrt:
    - both iterative and recursive approaches seem to work
    - leetcode gives "time exceeded" error for both
    - explore a binary search approach for this problem to limit the "possible" numbers
