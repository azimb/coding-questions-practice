Question:-
    - you are reading numbers of an array, one after the other.
    - need a method called getMedian that gets the 'current median'.
    (current median is the median of the numbers thus fars)
    - after each number is read, append the current median to the resultant list

Recall:
    - median is in the middle when the list is in sorted order
    - if there are twi midpoints, then median is the average of those two values
'''

# this method fetches the "current" median
def getMedian(arr):
    return 1;
